## Why a Blog?

Recursive Intelligence has always been about working carefully with language models — not just using them, but understanding what makes a prompt work, why a system behaves unexpectedly, and how to build pipelines that stay coherent over time. A lot of that knowledge lives in notebooks, conversation logs, and internal documents. This blog is where it surfaces.

## What to Expect

Posts here will cover prompt engineering methodology, architecture decisions for LLM-integrated systems, and occasional deep dives into specific tools or patterns. When something breaks in an interesting way, we will write about that too. The goal is precision over volume: fewer posts, more depth.

> "The map is not the territory — but a good map, built recursively, gets closer with every iteration."

## A Note on the Stack

This site is built with Next.js and processes posts through [contentlayer2](https://github.com/timlrx/contentlayer2), which means every MDX file is type-checked against a schema at build time. That constraint is intentional: structured frontmatter makes content queryable and keeps the rendering layer honest.

```ts
// Every post resolves a slug and reading time at build time
computedFields: {
  slug: { resolve: (post) => post._raw.flattenedPath.replace(/^blog\//, '') },
  readingTime: { resolve: (post) => Math.ceil(post.body.raw.split(/\s+/).length / 200) },
}
```

More soon.
